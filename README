The original README is in the doc/ directory.
I made some small changes to the Makefile so that this will compile under Ubuntu.
There will be LOTS of warnings because the original authors turned on all warnings, but it does compile just fine. At some point I may work through and try to eliminate some of these warnings, but at a glance it seems many of them are intentional behaviour.
I made this repo after noticing that the code was released under GPLv2 (hurray!). This makes it much easier to download and build on a modern Linux system.
